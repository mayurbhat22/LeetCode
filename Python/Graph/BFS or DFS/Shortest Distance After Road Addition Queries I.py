"""
In the beginning, distance from 0 to each node will be the node itself.
So, shortest_distance[i] means the distance at which node i is from 0.
So, for each query, add the edge into adjaceny list, and do a BFS from 0.
While doing BFS, the since the adj_list has changed, the shortest_distance will hold the shortest distance.

In order to save time, we can do a BFS from the edge u, in u â†’ v instead of 0. Since only that edge is changed for that particular query.
